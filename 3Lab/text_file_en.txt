Where in the sky of the stars

On one planet there were yellow shiny flowers.There was often sunny weather
- And the flowers sowed, reflecting the rays of the sun.

One day the weather was ruined.It became cold, snow went.
The flowers rolled their petals.Then when again appeared
The sun, the flowers blossomed, thinking that everything was over.
But suddenly a predatory wind flew - and the flowers could not stay!
They flew all over the space.Since the sky is sowing bright
yellow flowers that people call stars.





The candle family

A family of candles settled in one apartment.Life
was not bright: all day they looked out the window,
And in the evening - on the TV.

But one day in the house loud music -
And the candle family was invited to the festive table and
Put the flowers.To them with a bow came up
matches and gave every yellow hot hat.
Now candles have fun crawling and around the warm
Bright rays.And let the candles gradually become less and less -
But how cozy and good was at the table.They lived their own
Short life brightly!
